Designer Questions:
Are there specific responsive break-points to use?
Are the exact paddings and margins available, or is there a Figma or Sketch file to reference?
What is the font being used?
Are there specific shadow measurements?
Are there any psuedo-class changes or animations to include?
Is the text color for the price labels between tablet and desktop supposed to be different?

2. Are the exact paddings and margins available, or is there a Figma or Sketch file to reference?
3. What is the font being used?
4. Are there specific shadow measurements?
5. Are there any psuedo-class changes or animations to include?
6. Is the text color for the price labels between tablet and desktop supposed to be different?
7. How should the UI be reflected with a neutral change?
